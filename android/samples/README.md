The Test app uses all available screenlets so you can see how to use them in your apps. The Test app also lets you change some configuration parameters to modify the app's behavior or change the theme and viewset used to show the screenlets.

The [Westeros Bank app](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/tree/master/android/samples/bankofwesteros) is a real example using some screenlets to manage technical issues for the *Westeros Bank*. In this sample you'll learn how to use screenlets in a real-world app, and how to extend and customize standard screenlets and viewsets to meet your design requirements.

The Push Notifications app uses the [push portlet](https://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/48439053) and Liferay Portal to show global notifications and refresh the list each time a DDL record is added in the portal.
