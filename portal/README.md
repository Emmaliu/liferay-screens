# Liferay Screens's compatiblity plugin

## Introduction

This plugin is a portlet that exposes additional methods that are not present in Liferay's out-of-the-box API. These additional methods allow Liferay Screens to do certain operations that are needed for the screenlets to correctly work. 
We recommended to install this plugin on Liferay Portals offering back-end services to mobile apps built with Liferay Screens

## Installation

This is a normal Liferay portlet plugin, so please follow the normal installation process.
